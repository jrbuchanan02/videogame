    Introduction0: >
      When Videogame receives a plot, this text will inform you
      about the inciting incident and all of the tasks that you
      will have as the main character and hero of the story. Be
      prepared for text in multiple languages, sometimes without
      translation, and for the unexpected. Aunque tengo mucha
      experiencia en el español por mi lengua segunda, lo siento
      para los errores. 日本語は私の三言語です, and I wouldn't really
      say I know Japanese yet.
    Introduction1: >
      Either way, get ready for a wild ride and an RNG filled
      adventure! The storyline takes inspiration from famous
      (non-english writing) authors such as Miguel Cervantes, the
      author of Don Quixote, Rumiko Takahashi, the author of Ranma
      1/2 and Inuyasha, and Tite Kubo, the author of Bleach.
      However Videogame doesn't lean entirely on inspiration from
      outside sources since I will come up with plenty of my own
      concepts and ideas.
    Introduction2: "\n"
    Introduction3: >
      After the chracter has selected their attributes, the game
      will ask for the gender of their character (no, I'm not
      going to do that yet). Part of the RNG is that the game may
      randomize any aspect of the character (other than the name)
      after character creation.
    Introduction4: >
      A reference to the anime Ranma 1/2 (in Japanese, らんまニ部の一
      or らんま 1/2), the character's gender may even be
      randomized to change under certain conditions, such as
      getting hit with certain temperatures of water. Or, a concept
      I came up with, the character could be two people at once.
      One restriction on the form would be that it should remain
      humanoid. However, other than that restriction, the RNG can
      choose whatever it wants.
    Introduction5: >
      Videogame may also randomize the introduction and storyline,
      generating a truly unique and unexpected experience each time
      you start a new game. Perhaps references to other anime,
      manga, and pop culture will be cool?
    Introduction6: >
      Regardless, you have reached the end of the hypothetical
      character creation scene. There is no storyline yet, so what
      you just did was only symbolic, and the program will exit as
      soon as you press enter.
    CharacterCreation0: >
      At this point, you would enter the character creation
      process. The game would ask you for your name and there
      would be a line break as it shows you this prompt (for your
      character's name):
    CharacterCreation1: >
      Then the game would list out attributes that you can choose
      for your character. These attributes would give your
      character,
    CharacterCreation2: >
      , certain advantages or disadvantages throughout the game.
